also use a global '.ycm_extra_conf.py' that will search for a clang compilation database and use it to figure out how the file you're editing is compiled and provide you with completions based on that.

To get completion working for a CMake project with my setup all I have to do is create a build directroy and invoke CMake with -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=y so that it'll generate a 'compile_commands.json' file.
